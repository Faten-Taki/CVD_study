# relationship between CVD and stress. 



#The associated R file in the CVD_study folder includes the scripts used to analyze/generate the figures for the manuscript. 

#The associated script covers data visualization code for Figures 2B, and Figures 3A, 3B, 3C. It also includes code to compute input data for Figure 2C, 
#Figure 2D, and Figure 3D. Other figures (Figure 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and Figure 2A) were done in Excel.
